# Description
Objective:
The primary goal of this task is to create a fully functional quiz application that can dynamically load questions, evaluate user responses, and display scores in real time. The quiz should be intuitive and interactive, providing a smooth experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

Functional Requirements:
Question and Answer Interface:

The app should display one question at a time.

Each question must have multiple answer options (preferably 4).

Users should be able to select only one answer per question.

Clicking an option should lock the answer and instantly indicate whether it is correct or not.

Instant Feedback:

After a user selects an option, the app must immediately show whether the chosen answer is correct or incorrect.

Correct answers should be highlighted in green, while incorrect answers should be marked in red.

Optionally, a short explanation for the correct answer can be shown to enhance learning.

Scoring System:

Maintain and display a running score as users proceed through the quiz.

Each correct answer should increment the score.

At the end of the quiz, show the total score and percentage.

Dynamic Question Loading:

Questions should be loaded dynamically from a JSON object or an external source (like a file or database).

This allows flexibility in updating or changing the question set without altering the applicationâ€™s structure.

Responsive Design:

The quiz interface must be responsive and function well across different devices and screen sizes.

CSS should be used to ensure a visually appealing layout and style.

Navigation:

Include buttons for moving to the next question.

Once all questions are answered, show a summary page with the total score and feedback.

Optionally, include a "Restart Quiz" button.

Technical Guidelines:
Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for development. No backend is required for this task.

Use JavaScript's DOM manipulation to render questions and handle interactions.

Ensure that your code is well-commented and organized for readability.

Store your project in a GitHub repository, as per internship instructions.

Deliverables:
You are expected to submit a polished and fully functional quiz application that includes scoring, dynamic question loading, and interactive feedback. The app must be intuitive, responsive, and bug-free. Ensure that the UI is neatly styled using CSS and provides a pleasant user experience.

Learning Outcome:
By completing this task, you will gain hands-on experience in building dynamic web applications using JavaScript. You will learn to manage state, handle user input, update the UI based on data, and structure your code for scalability. These skills are crucial for any front-end developer and form the foundation for more complex applications.

In summary, Task 1 is an excellent opportunity to showcase your JavaScript skills by creating a practical and interactive web application. Ensure timely submission and adherence to all guidelines to earn your internship completion certificate.
